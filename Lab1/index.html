    <h2>Q1:Define HTML. (1 mark)</h2>
    <h3>A1:HTML,HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language</h3>

    <h2>Q2:Define Client-server model of communications. (1 mark)</h2>

        A client is a computer agent that makes requrests and receives responses from the server, in the form of response codes, images, test files, and other data.</h3>

    <h2>Q3:Write down the name of different types of servers. (1 mark)</h2>
    <h3>A3:Web server, Email server, Media server, Data server, Application server, Authentication server.</h3>

    <h2>Q4:Define a Web Server. (1 mark)</h2>
    <h3>A4: A web server is, at a fundamental level, nothing more than a computer that responds to HTTP requests.</h3>

    <h2>Q5:Define Data Centers. (1 mark)</h2>
    <h3>A5:Server farms are typically housed in special facilities called data centers.</h3>

    <h2>Q6:Why do we need a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)? (1 mark)</h2>
    <h3>A6:In order to allow clients to request particular resources from the server.</h3>

    <h2>Q7:Give an example of Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and specify all components of an URL. (2 marks)</h2>
    <h3>A7:http://www.funwebdev.com/index.php?page=17#article<br>
        <ul>
            <li>http -- protocol</li>
            <li>www.funwebdev.com -- domain</li>
            <li>index.php -- path</li>
            <li>page=17 -- query string</li>
            <li>article -- fragment</li>

    <h2>Q8:What is the difference between a static and a dynamic web site? (1 mark)</h2>

        The page content of dynamic web site is being created at run-time by a program; this page content can vary for user to user. 
    </h3>

    <h2>Q9:Why do we need Domain Name System (DNS)? (1 mark)</h2>
    <h3>A9:Human beings do not enjoy having to recall long strings of numbers (IP addresses).</h3>

    <h2>Q10:Describe in detail the process of DNS address resolution? (3 marks)</h2>
    <h3>A10:The process of DNS address resolution
        <ol>
            <li>Input a domain name in web browser, DNS Resolver check it's in browser's cache or not.</li>
            <li>If domain name in browser's cache, return IP address to browser and then browser requrests pages.</li>
            <li>If domain name is not in browser's cache, resolver makes request for IP address to ISP's DNS Server.</li>
            <li>If ISP's DNS Server found domain name in it's DNS cache, return IP address to DNS Resolver.</li>
            <li>If the primary DNS server doesn't have the domain name in its DNS cache, it sends out to the root name server.</li>
            <li>Root name server returns IP of name server for requested TLD.</li>
            <li>The primary DNS server request IP of name server for the domain name.</li>
            <li>gTLD server will return IP address of DNS server for this domain name.</li>
            <li>The primary DNS server request for IP address for this domain name to DNS server.</li>
            <li>DNS serer return IP address of web server to Primary DNS server, and then it return to DNS resolver.</li>
            <li>Then, DNS resolver return IP address the domain name to web browser.</li>
            <li>Web browser request page to Web server based on IP address.</li>
            <li>Web server returns requested page to web browser.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Q11:Give some examples of generic top-Level domains (gTLD). (1 mark)</h2>

    <h2>Q12:Give some examples of country code top-Level domains (ccTLD). (1 mark)</h2>
    <h3>A12:.ca, .us, .fr</h3>

    <h2>Q13:How can you pass a userâ€™s information from the client to the web server? (1 mark)</h2>
    <h3>A13:
        Web browsers can place data into the web requests for passing inforamtion to the web server.
    </h3>

    <h2>Q14:What is the function (purpose) of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)? (1 mark)</h2>
    <h3>A14: The function of HTTP is to establish a TCP connection on port 80 (by default) with the server and send HTML pages back to the user's browser.</h3>
